### Tic-Tac-Toe Game Explanation

Hey there, everyone!

It's me, Gc, and I've got something super fun to share with you all - a classic game called X-O (Tic-Tac-Toe) brought to life in Python!

Now, here's the deal: we've got a grid, just like a game board, and you'll be making your moves by entering row and column numbers. But remember, we start counting from zero, so keep that in mind when plotting your X's and O's!

But hey, this is where the real magic happens. Together, we can tweak and enhance the game, fixing any pesky bugs we come across, and creating a fantastic gaming experience that'll keep everyone entertained. ðŸŽ®

#### Game Overview

Tic-Tac-Toe is a classic two-player game played on a 3x3 grid. Players take turns marking empty spaces with their symbols (X or O) aiming to get three symbols in a row, column, or diagonal.

#### Key Features

- **Board:** Represents a 3x3 grid where players place X or O.
- **Win Condition:** A player wins by aligning three of their symbols horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
- **Turn Alternation:** Players alternate turns, starting with X.
- **Game End:** The game ends when a player wins or the board is full (tie).

#### How to Play

- **Turns:** Players input their moves by selecting a row and column.
- **Winning:** The game checks after each move for a winning combination.
- **Tie:** If the board fills up without a winner, the game ends in a tie.

#### User Interaction

- **Input:** Players select a position to place their symbol (X or O).
- **Output:** The board updates after each move, showing the current state.

#### Computer Move Algorithm

- **Strategy:** Uses minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning.
- **Winning Move:** Checks for a move that leads to an immediate win.
- **Blocking Move:** If no winning move, blocks opponent's potential win.
- **Random Move:** If neither, picks a random empty spot.

#### Implementation Details

- **Initialization:** Starts with an empty board.
- **Board Display:** Prints the current board state.
- **Win Check:** Verifies if a player has won after each move.
- **Game Loop:** Controls turns between player and computer.

#### Why Play Tic-Tac-Toe?

- **Foundational Game:** Teaches programming basics like loops and conditions.
- **AI Introduction:** Introduces AI concepts through minimax algorithm.
- **Expandability:** Can be expanded with larger boards or smarter AI.


So grab your coding hats, and let's get this game rolling!

Happy coding and have a blast!

Cheers,
